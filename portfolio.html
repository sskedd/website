After choosing, it generates your personalized flower with a pretty background consisting of grass, a tree, sun, bird and a butterfly. To make our game, we primarily utilized the python turtle commands using Replit.</h1>

    <h1> In this project, my partner and I analyzed decades worth of data related to honey production. We used this data to determine if there is a correlation between the amount of honey produced in the country and the strength of our bee colonies. And we found that according to the data, honey production has increased over the years. This means that bees are being over harvested which is resulting in a decline of bee population and collapse on a large scale, as a consequence, our crops may not pollinate and our food supply may begin to decline.
